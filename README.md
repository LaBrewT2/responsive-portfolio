# responsive-portfolio1

I figured out that keeping each page within the container would keep every layout consistant.

I realized that in order for the hamburger menu to work i needed to connect the JavaScript link to each page.

I'm not understanding why the pages are not responsive. My about page layout is not matching the example, and my portfolio layout will not shrink to one column when the page is made to mobile size.

My contact sheet will not center.
